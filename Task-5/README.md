# üèè IPL Cricket Database ‚Äì Task 5: SQL Joins (Inner, Left, Right, Full)

## üìå Overview
This is **Task 5** focusing on **combining data from multiple tables** in the IPL Cricket Database.  
The task demonstrates how to use `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN` (via `UNION` in Oracle) to retrieve related data from different tables.

---

## üéØ Objective
- Learn to merge data from two or more tables  
- Understand the differences between join types  
- Retrieve combined information from players, teams, matches, and scores  
- Use `FULL JOIN` simulation in Oracle with `UNION`  

---

## üóÇ Topics Covered
1. **INNER JOIN** ‚Äì Retrieve only matching rows from both tables  
2. **LEFT JOIN** ‚Äì All rows from the left table, plus matching rows from the right table  
3. **RIGHT JOIN** ‚Äì All rows from the right table, plus matching rows from the left table  
4. **FULL OUTER JOIN** ‚Äì All rows from both tables (in Oracle, simulated using `UNION`)

## üõ† Example Operations

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ INNER JOIN
```sql
-- Players with their team names
SELECT P.PLAYER_NAME, T.TEAM_NAME
FROM PLAYER P
INNER JOIN TEAM T ON P.TEAM_ID = T.TEAM_ID;
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ LEFT JOIN
```sql
-- All players and their scores (include players without scores)
SELECT P.PLAYER_NAME, S.RUNS, S.WICKETS, S.CATCHES
FROM PLAYER P
LEFT JOIN SCORE S ON P.PLAYER_ID = S.PLAYER_ID;
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ RIGHT JOIN
```sql
-- All scores and the corresponding player names
SELECT S.SCORE_ID, P.PLAYER_NAME, S.RUNS, S.WICKETS
FROM PLAYER P
RIGHT JOIN SCORE S ON P.PLAYER_ID = S.PLAYER_ID;
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ FULL OUTER JOIN (Oracle Method)
```sql
-- All players and all scores
SELECT P.PLAYER_NAME, S.RUNS, S.WICKETS
FROM PLAYER P
LEFT JOIN SCORE S ON P.PLAYER_ID = S.PLAYER_ID
UNION
SELECT P.PLAYER_NAME, S.RUNS, S.WICKETS
FROM PLAYER P
RIGHT JOIN SCORE S ON P.PLAYER_ID = S.PLAYER_ID;
```
